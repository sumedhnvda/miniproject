face recognition software using open cv
here datacollect.py file will take 500 black and white image of the user 
later the train.py will train on these photo It breaks down each face's texture into patterns, creating histograms that are like unique 'face fingerprints'. 
then in model.py when user show their face system calculates its pattern and compares it to trained data. If they match, bingo! The face is recognized. If not then 'unknown'
